# Movie Recommendation System | Spark  

**Big Data Processing Technology Class**  
**Beijing Institute of Technology**  

## Project Overview  
This project involves the development of a **Movie Recommendation System** using **Apache Spark**. The system is designed to recommend movies based on user preferences, leveraging the **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** algorithm for collaborative filtering.  

Key highlights include:  
- Implementation of the ALS algorithm.  
- Optimization of model parameters using **grid search**.  
- Achieved **low RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**, ensuring accurate and reliable recommendations.  

## Features  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user-item interaction data to make personalized recommendations.  
- **Parameter Tuning**: Employs grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the ALS model.  
- **Scalability**: Built using Spark, ensuring efficient handling of large-scale data.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Apache Spark**  
- **Python**
- **Big Data Frameworks**  

## Performance  
- Achieved low RMSE, indicating high-quality recommendations.  

## Installation & Usage  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install the required dependencies.  
3. Configure the dataset in the appropriate directory.  
4. Run the Spark application using the provided scripts.
